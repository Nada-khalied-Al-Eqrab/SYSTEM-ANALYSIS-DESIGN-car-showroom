# Car Dealership System - System Analysis and Design

This project focuses on the analysis and design of a system for a car dealership. The goal is to create a system that can manage all aspects of car dealership operations, from displaying cars to selling and delivering them.

## Project Overview

The car dealership system will manage multiple aspects of operations, including:

*   **Car Management:** Register car information, track their status, manage their images, and set their prices.
*   **Customer Management:** Register customer information, track their interests, and manage their interactions with the dealership.
*   **Sales Management:** Record sales transactions, manage invoices, and track payments.
*   **Inventory Management:** Track car inventory, manage orders, and receive new cars.
*   **Employee Management:** Manage employee information, assign tasks, and track their performance.
*   **Report Management:** Generate periodic reports on sales, inventory, and employee performance.

## System Architecture

The system architecture will consist of the following components:

*   **User Interface:** A user-friendly graphical interface for employees and customers.
*   **Database:** Stores all system data, including information on cars, customers, sales, and employees.
*   **Car Management Module:** Manages all aspects of car information, from registration to setting prices.
*   **Customer Management Module:** Registers customer information, tracks their interests, and manages their interactions.
*   **Sales Management Module:** Records sales transactions, manages invoices, and tracks payments.
*   **Inventory Management Module:** Tracks car inventory, manages orders, and receives new cars.
*   **Employee Management Module:** Manages employee information, assigns tasks, and tracks their performance.
*   **Report Management Module:** Generates periodic reports on sales, inventory, and employee performance.

## Diagrams

The following diagrams will be created as part of the system analysis and design process:

*   **Context Diagram (Three Levels):**
    *   Level 0: Shows the system as a whole and the interactions with external entities, such as customers, suppliers, and banks.
    *   Level 1: Shows the major processes within the system, such as car management, customer management, and sales management.
    *   Level 2: Provides more details about the sub-processes within each major process.
*   **Database Diagram:** Illustrates the structure of the database, including tables and the relationships between them.
*   **Other Diagrams:** Use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, data flow diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams.

## Project Status

*   **Analysis Phase:** Completed
*   **Design Phase:** In progress
*   **Development Phase:** Not started
*   **Testing Phase:** Not started
*   **Deployment Phase:** Not started

## Conclusion

This project represents an ambitious effort to develop a comprehensive system for managing a car dealership. By leveraging the latest technologies and following best practices in systems analysis and design, we aim to create a system that effectively meets the needs of users and contributes to improving the efficiency of operations in car dealerships.
